\title{Create a Distance Matrix Corresponding to the Aggregated Result of the
  Ranked Model Distances}
\usage{
Models.dist.rank.aggregate(models, distance = RegressionResult.dist.default,
  rank.all = rank.dist, rank.fromSingle = identity, aggregate = mean,
  cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{the \code{\link[processMineR.models]{Models}} records}

\item{distance}{the
\code{\link[regressoR]{RegressionResult}}-to-\code{\link[regressoR]{RegressionResult}}
 distance metric}

\item{aggregate}{the function used for joining the models created by
\code{distance}}

\item{cores}{the number of CPU cores to use}
}
\value{
an instance of \code{\link[stats]{dist}}
}
\description{
A distance matrix is constructed which represents the aggregated
  ranked distances between the models. This should be robust against some odd
  outliers.
